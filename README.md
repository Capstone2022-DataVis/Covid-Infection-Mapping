Project Title: Opensource Covid Infection Mapping (with Google Maps API)

Project background (target audience is non-technical)
what problem are you solving or need are you addressing? My goal is to make it easy to understand covid cases/severity with data visualization.  Right now, I’m only hearing about the infection rate, infection density, lessening hospital capacity, etc. Who knows if it is safe to visit another country or region of the US with this information? If California is full of covid cases (and has a low hospital capacity), maybe a user would choose to go to another state for vacation instead? Modeling this data in Google Maps would make this data easier to understand… and also allow me to practice web development (a subject that I don’t have much experience in). 
who will use it? People planning trips around the US, researchers studying infectious disease, and local governments working on their Pandemic response plan. 
what will it do for the users? Display a heatmap of covid infection rates via Google Maps (Likely, US only but this is subject to change).
how will you measure success? unknown.

Features:
describe in detail key elements
Data Set (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data)
Public website that displays the map for users
A way for users to interact with the map
Allow users to change the data set (ex: from Infection Rate to Hospital Capacity) and see the updated display
Keeps the data up to date
Web scraping capabilities to get updated data
use “use cases” to describe
Average Person -> Planning trips around the country, deciding if it’s safe to go into the office, etc. 
Medical Personal -> Using this visualization in a research project, instructing the public on pandemic safety, helping determine appropriate government/hospital regulations for the area (ex: comparing different areas of the US to determine the most effective regulations).
Government Official -> Understanding the numbers coming from Medical Personal, determining local policy, instructing the public on safety, etc. 

Technologies required for project:
mobile, web, desktop, other?
Web (I am open to mobile)
Languages
Java, JavaScript
Tools
Google Maps API (this does cost money so I will need to be careful: $0.007 per 100,000 map loads)
Google AdSense (if people actually use this site AND it evolves from a prototype)
Frameworks / Libraries
Looking into: React, Django, D3
SaaS components
N/A

Barriers to completing this project:
appropriate scope
I don’t have much experience with this type of project but it seems like this project may be too easy… will need to be discussed. At the same time, there is a lot of room for additional capabilities (like adding support for more countries, new types of data like Hospital capacity, etc.). 
Skills?
I have little experience with JavaScript or web dev 
Knowledge?
Same as above
Time?
Heavy course load this semester… so I’ll have to be on the ball and dedicate a certain amount of minimum work time for this project every week. 
work environment?
My apartment/coffee shop down the road when I get bored
Complexity?
It seems like this project will get more complex once I understand it more… also there is a lot of room to add capabilities. 
access to data/tools?
Lots of data for US infections online so this will not be an issue

Next steps to address barriers:
Reading / Youtube tutorials on JavaScript, hosting a website, and Google Maps API
Keep planning this project so I can start ASAP
Ask about the appropriate scope
