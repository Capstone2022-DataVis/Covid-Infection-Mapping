# Opensource Covid Infection Mapping
Project background (target audience is non-technical)
what problem are you solving or need are you addressing? Our goal is to make it easy to understand covid cases/severity with data visualization.  Right now, I’m only hearing about nationwide infection rate, lessening hospital capacity, etc. Who knows if it is safe to visit another country or region of the US with this information? If California is full of covid cases (and has a low hospital capacity), maybe a user would choose to go to another state for vacation instead? Modeling this data with Google Maps would make this data easier to understand (actually, very easy to understand)… and also allow us to practice web development. 
who will use it? People planning trips around the US, researchers studying infectious disease, and local governments working on their Pandemic response plan. 
what will it do for the users? Display a heatmap of covid infection rates via Google Maps (Likely, US only but this is subject to change).

Features:
describe in detail key elements
Data Set (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data)
Public website that displays the map for users
A way for users to interact with the map
Allow users to change the data set (ex: from Infection Rate to Hospital Capacity) and see the updated display
Keeps the data up to date
Web scraping capabilities to get updated data
use “use cases” to describe
Average Person -> Planning trips around the country, deciding if it’s safe to go into the office, etc. 
Medical Personal -> Using this visualization in a research project, instructing the public on pandemic safety, helping determine appropriate government/hospital regulations for the area (ex: comparing different areas of the US to determine the most effective regulations).
Government Official -> Understanding the numbers coming from Medical Personal, determining local policy, instructing the public on safety, etc. 

Technologies required for project:
mobile, web, desktop, other?
Web 
Languages
Java, JavaScript
Tools
Google Maps API (this does cost money: $0.007 per 100,000 map loads)
Google AdSense (if people actually use this site AND it evolves from a prototype)
Frameworks / Libraries
Looking into: React, Django, D3
SaaS components
N/A

Barriers to completing this project:
appropriate scope
We both don’t have much experience with this type of project… so the scope may need to be adjusted down the road. Luckily, with this idea, there is a lot of room for additional capabilities (like adding support for more countries, new types of data like Hospital capacity, etc.). Initially, we will start with NC specifically and ideally expand to the whole US. 
Skills?
We have little experience with JavaScript or web dev as a whole
Knowledge?

Time?
Heavy course load this semester… so we’ll have to be on the ball and dedicate a certain amount of minimum work time for this project every week. 
work environment?
Apartment / coffee shop / library 
Complexity?
It seems like this project will get more complex once we understand it more. We will need to be careful with the scope (both too small and large). 
access to data/tools?
Lots of data for US infections (and other covid related data) online so this will not be an issue

Next steps to address barriers:
Reading / Youtube tutorials on JavaScript, hosting a website, and Google Maps API
Keep planning this project so it can be started ASAP
Discuss with Dr. Wilkes, Dr. Feng ,and others about the appropriate scope
Dr. Feng's advice was to make sure our data works with Tableau -> then use the D3 library for our website (ex: Tableau is to Excel as D3 is to Python).
